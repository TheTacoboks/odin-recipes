    <h2>Description</h2>
    This potato kielbasa skillet is the answer to that ongoing quest for a meal that satisfies both the heart and the stomach in under 30 minutes. You’ll start with crispy red potatoes, then add savory smoked kielbasa, onions and finally bacon for good measure. But don’t worry—there’s a green vegetable too. A generous helping of spinach wilts perfectly into the mix, adding a fresh dimension to this deeply comforting skillet dish. It’s simple ingredients and no unnecessary fuss, with big rewards.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the potatoes and water in a microwave-safe dish. Cover the dish and microwave on high until the potatoes are tender, three to four minutes. Drain the potatoes and set them aside.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar, vinegar, mustard, thyme and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and sausage slices, then saute, stirring occasionally, until the onion is tender and translucent, five to seven minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked potatoes to the skillet. Cook and stir until the potatoes are lightly browned, three to five minutes. Stir in the brown sugar mixture, and bring the skillet to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for two minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the spinach until it’s wilted, then stir in the crumbled bacon. Serve immediately.</li>
